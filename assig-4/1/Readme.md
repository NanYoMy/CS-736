The code is in code folder.
The report is in the html folder of the report folder (just open it in chrome).
The weights were very small (3*3) so I have not displayed them in the report, you can have a look at the image however from the report folder.

ALso note that the residual image was displayed using imshow(image,[]); which enhances the features in the image so that they become more visibly clear.
The actual image does have features but it hard to look at them with normal imshow.
